There is no such thing as green in the countryside, but there are an infinity of hues called ‘green.’ To the artistic eye, to the country soul, nature makes her art in more colours than heart and head can hold. Neither are their fields of cows, though that is what they’re called. There are herds of four legged friends, each of them unique. Neither words nor photographs can capture what is here. Between hedgerows that grow a metre every spring, amid the fields that show each day's climate happenings, is a life only the soul can touch and echo its findings to the head in hope of bringing the peace of clarity. ; Jacek Yerka ; minimalism ; simplicity
