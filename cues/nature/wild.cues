From the blackest noble night to the whitest light of day, there is a beauty to nature that speaks every language straight to the heart.
---
In those brown skinned arms, that wave in woodland winds, that hold aloft a bounty of green such as only warm eyes can ever see, is a beauty of nature sweet enough to invite you in.
---
Nature's beauty is an echo of creation's song, it lives out there and within, as if we are spoken into being together and so belong.
---
When you feel nature's mirror seek to reflect itself from within your soul, to show you what generations have long forgotten, and raise you into the protectors role - then you have opened your eyes to the beauty of nature and given her the right to see your own.
---
Nature's beauty comes as if she is God's daydream, she comes as an archway of flora, she comes as an outstretched green hand.

There is no such thing as green in the countryside, but there are an infinity of hues called ‘green.’ To the artistic eye, to the country soul, nature makes her art in more colours than heart and head can hold. Neither are their fields of cows, though that is what they’re called. There are herds of four legged friends, each of them unique. Neither words nor photographs can capture what is here. Between hedgerows that grow a metre every spring, amid the fields that show each day's climate happenings, is a life only the soul can touch and echo its findings to the head in hope of bringing the peace of clarity.
---
The countryside is tree and birdsong together in one sensory palette.
---
The countryside peeks up from her green quilts into the springtime blue-white heavens.
---
The countryside glows green in the light of a bright sun.
---
The countryside coaxes my inner energy to flow in ways that weave my soul into the land.
---
The countryside expands her lungs, raising up land that is her glowing skin.
---
In this expanse of green there are more hues than anyone has ever named, yet here they are for any eye to see. The land rolls as it always has, as if it feels that time and space are one thing, that it rolls through the ages as much as to the horizon. Over it is laid a path, one that branches through the open landscape, and as I begin to walk there is a frisson of joy for all the choices to come, each one of them laden with discoveries.

The countryside beckoned. Today was a day of sunshine and rambling for Eddie, with way too many apples packing out his bag. The sunshine was brilliant but not yet with the heat of late spring. The fields were no longer swathes of rutted mud, each one was softly verdant, the new stems ruffled by the light breeze. The hills rolled like a casually laid eiderdown quilt, rising and falling in soft waves. Eddie walked up the muddy path, his senses soaking in the changes since he had last walked this way in winter. The air had more warmth and more fragrance. The music to meet his ears was an auditory painting from the winged artists as they called, sung and raised their new families in the treetops.

The countryside had been put to sleep under a blanket of white. The boughs glistened with frost; the air hung silent and cold. The only way in and out of the village was with a tow from the tractor; for five pounds Mr Green would attache a rope to your car and take you as far as the brow of scarface hill. The population of the village had doubled, the new half being made of snow and ice. It was odd to see the fields so quiet, the cows and pigs hiding in the warm barns and pens instead of roaming. Every Sunday afternoon of the big "snow in," right after church, every kid in the village got a ride to the top of Scarface in Mr Green's hay trailer so they could toboggan down, no cars allowed, just kids...

The countryside lay before him like a divine fingerprint, curving and changing, no two parts the same. In all the world this view was unique, such is the way of the organic world. The dip and sway of the land, the patterns and species of flora, the every changing sky and wind. Every day was a new snapshot in time, for even this one place, this view from one fine oak tree on a hill, could never be exactly the same two days in a row. Little by little the seasons would bring changes. River's mind wandered back to the far away city, his home, it had its rhythms too: the start and ending of school years, the vacations of summer and the winter festivals. Yet the countryside had a way of reminding him that he wasn't apart from nature, but a part of nature. Often on these travels he'd reach out to touch the bark of the trees as he passed or feel the softness of new leaves...

The forest was a world of silence. Deep snow had buried all that was in it but the trees, and it looked to her like the world outside her father’s house in seasons when the snow fell there, too, for days at a time and they waited for storms to stop, then built up their own fire, put on snowshoes made of wood and skins, and stepped outside.

Nannie had asked her once in a letter how she could live up here alone with all the quiet, and that was Deanna’s answer: when human conversation stopped, the world was anything but quiet. She lived with wood thrushes for company.

You and the tree in your backyard come from a common ancestor. A billion and a half years ago, the two of you parted ways. But even now, after an immense journey in separate directions, that tree and you still share a quarter of your genes…
---
Maybe trees do have souls. Which makes wood a kind of flesh. And perhaps instruments of wooden construction sound so pleasing to our ears for this reason: the choral shimmer of a guitar; the heartbeat thump of drums; the mournful wail of violins–we love them because they sound like us.
---
I learned to plait my hair back, so it would not catch on every twig, and how to tie my skirts at the knee to keep the burrs off. I learned to recognise the different blooming vines and gaudy roses, to spot the shining dragonflies and coiling snakes. I climbed the peaks where the cypresses speared black into the sky, then clambered down to the orchards and vineyards where purple grapes grew thick as coral.

Winter tightened its grip on Alaska. The vastness of the landscape dwindled down to the confines of their cabin. The sun rose at quarter past ten in the morning and set only fifteen minutes after the end of the school day. Less than six hours of light a day. Snow fell endlessly, blanketed everything. It piled up in drifts and spun its lace across windowpanes, leaving them nothing to see except themselves.

When we re-wild Earth, we renew our souls, we rejoin the soul ether and gain the spiritual assistance our ancestors once called "magic.
---
Wild is natural, wild is good, wild is where we learn empathy and joy through the art of play. So come with me, join the wind, breathe the stars and feel the sweetness of saving worlds.
---
Wild animals love and nurture, so be wild of heart and I assure you, you'll be doing it right.
---
The woods stood as great shadows brought to life by festive hand, as if they had been called forth from a wintry land.
---
The woods crowned the land with protective grace, an ever evolving map, its strong roots holding the earth firm in all weathers.
---
The woods, my kin of brown and green, my happy place of sanctuary and jocund solitude.
---
The water ways of the woods, the blues and white lace amid the earthy hues, amid the dance of green, come together as a visual form of poetry, one read by the naked soul.
---
For the eye that captures moments as easily as a camera lens, the woods offer a chorus of browns leading up to a seasonal cupola. And with this image it weaves nature's aromas and hearty birdsong. Thus on any given day, at any time, in any weather, the woods can tether my spirit in the most soothing of ways.
---
In the community that is the woods, from the trees to the insects and birds, there is a sense of divine peace that settles soul and spirit.
---
The woods breathe in easy greens upon strong wands of brown.
---
If one had only seen woods as a photograph, it would be your dearest wish to take a stroll amid the trees with senses open wide.
---
In the dappled sunlight amid the boughs and strong risen roots, I can feel my spirit weave itself into nature, as if for this time I am one with this place and all the life that is here.
---
A celebration of browns and greens await us in the woods, for these are the colours or nature's finest dreams.
