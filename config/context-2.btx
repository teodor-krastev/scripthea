Originating in France, Impressionism broke from academic tradition by focusing on the immediate sensory effect of a scene—the "impression." Artists moved out of the studio to paint *en plein air*. They used short, broken brushstrokes and unblended vibrant colors to capture the changing qualities of light and the passage of time. The subjects were often ordinary, everyday scenes rather than historical or mythological events, prioritizing atmosphere over precise detail.

Post-Impressionism arose as a reaction against Impressionism’s naturalistic concern for light and color. While retaining vivid colors and thick paint application, Post-Impressionists  introduced more structure and subjective expression. They emphasized geometric forms, distorted forms for expressive effect, and used unnatural color to convey emotion. It was not a unified style but a collective shift toward abstraction and symbolic content.

Art Nouveau, this international style sought to modernize design by abandoning historical revivals. It is characterized by organic, flowing lines resembling stems and blossoms, often referred to as "whiplash" curves. The style bridged the gap between fine and applied arts, heavily influencing architecture, graphic design, glasswork, and jewelry with its decorative, asymmetrical, and nature-inspired aesthetic.

Fauvism was the first avant-garde movement of the 20th century. The name translates to "wild beasts" (*les fauves*), referring to the artists' aggressive use of strong, unnatural colors directly from the tube. They separated color from its descriptive purpose, using it instead to project a mood or structure a space. The style is defined by painterly qualities, simplified forms, and a rejection of three-dimensional space.

Cubism is often considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century. It abandoned perspective and realistic modeling. Instead, artists analyzed subjects, broke them up, and reassembled them in an abstracted form. This allowed objects to be depicted from multiple viewpoints simultaneously within a single plane. The style is marked by fragmented geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and collage elements.

Emerging primarily in Germany, Expressionism prioritized the artist's subjective emotions over objective reality. Artists sought to depict the "angst" of the modern world. They employed distortion, exaggeration, primitivism, and jarring, violent colors to evoke a visceral emotional response from the viewer. It was often a reaction to the anxieties caused by urbanization and the impending World War.

Influenced by Freudian psychology, Surrealism sought to unlock the creative potential of the unconscious mind. Artists depicted dream worlds and bizarre juxtapositions of ordinary objects. The style ranges from hyper-realistic renderings of illogical scenes to pure abstraction. The goal was to bypass reason and rationality to reveal a deeper, often unsettling, psychological reality.

Abstract Expressionism, the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence, placing New York City at the center of the art world. Artists viewed the canvas as an arena for action. The style is characterized by "action painting"—drip and splash techniques—or large "color fields" meant to engulf the viewer. It emphasizes spontaneity, non-representational forms, and the physical act of painting itself as an expression of the subconscious.

Pop Art emerged in the UK and US as a challenge to the elitist traditions of fine art. It utilized imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books, and mundane cultural objects. Artists used commercial techniques like silk-screening to remove the "hand of the artist," often employing irony and parody to comment on consumerism, celebrity culture, and mass media production.

Minimalism sought to remove all metaphors, expressiveness, and social commentary from art, focusing solely on the object itself. Artists utilized simple geometric forms, industrial materials, and repetition. The work is literal; what you see is what you see. It rejects the idea that art should reflect the personal feelings of the artist, aiming instead for pure objectivity, order, and simplicity.
