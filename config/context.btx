Impressionism : Luminous, broken colour and swift brushstrokes capturing fleeting light, weather, and everyday life; favors outdoor scenes, visible paint, and the sensory impression of a moment over precise detail or narrative.
---
Post-Impressionism : Builds on Impressionism but pushes toward structure, symbolism, or emotion; intensified color, personal vision, and experiments with form, from Seurat's dots to Van Gogh's swirling, expressive lines.
---
Realism : Focus on ordinary people, workers, and unidealized scenes; detailed, sober representation of contemporary life, often with social or political critique, rejecting romantic heroism or classical perfection.
---
Romanticism : Dramatic, emotional, and often sublime subjects; sweeping landscapes, historical dramas, and exotic or mystical themes; expressive color and gesture emphasizing individual feeling and imagination over rational order.
---
Symbolism : Dreamlike, poetic imagery standing for inner states, myths, or spiritual ideas; muted or mysterious color, stylized forms, and allegories that prioritize mood and suggestion over literal realism.
---
Fauvism : Explosively bright, non-naturalistic colors in broad, simplified shapes; loose brushwork and strong outlines; aims for emotional impact and decorative harmony rather than realistic depth or modeling.
---
Cubism : Fragmented objects viewed from multiple angles at once; geometric planes, muted palettes, and shallow space; dissolves traditional perspective to analyze form and structure on the flat surface.
---
Expressionism : Distorted forms, harsh or heightened color, and agitated line; subjective, often anxious views of modern life; the world is reshaped to mirror inner turmoil or intense feeling.
---
Surrealism : Juxtaposes realistic detail with bizarre, dreamlike combinations; draws on psychoanalysis, chance, and automatic drawing to reveal unconscious desires, fears, and irrational narratives.
---
Abstract Expressionism : Large-scale, nonrepresentational painting emphasizing gesture, process, and immediacy; drips, fields, or swaths of color convey raw emotion and existential intensity rather than depicting recognizable subjects.
