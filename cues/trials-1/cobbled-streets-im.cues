Buildings on either side of the street are tall and have large windows, giving ample light to the busy street below. The street itself flows like a river, with people and vehicles moving along in a seamless motion. The colors used in the painting are warm and inviting, with shades of yellow, orange, and red dominating the scene. Overall, the painting captures the vibrancy and energy of a city on a sunny day.
