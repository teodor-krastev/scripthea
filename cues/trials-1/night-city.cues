There is a certain sense of chaos in the painting, as if anything could happen at any moment on these bustling streets. But despite this, there is also a sense of order and harmony, as each element of the painting is carefully balanced and composed.
Overall, "In the night the city streets become arteries of light around the heart of our metropolis" is an impressive work of impressionist art that captures the essence of a vibrant urban scene at night. The use of color, light, and movement creates a dynamic and engaging painting that draws the viewer in and invites them to explore this bustling cityscape.
